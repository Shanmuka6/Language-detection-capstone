# Language Detection Capstone

Welcome to the **Language Detection Capstone** project! This project aims to detect the language of a given text input using machine learning techniques and a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tools. It provides a simple and efficient way to analyze text and determine the language in real-time.

---

## Features

- **Language Detection**: Identify the language of the given text.
- **Multi-language Support**: Detects a wide range of languages.
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Utilizes NLP and machine learning for accuracy and speed.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Command-line tool for quick and easy usage.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: For text processing.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
- **pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shanmuka6/Language-detection-capstone.git
   cd Language-detection-capstone
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Run the script to detect the language of a sample text:
   ```bash
   python language_detection.py
   ```

2. Input your text when prompted, and the program will display the detected language.

---

## How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**: Text input is cleaned and preprocessed.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts n-grams or other linguistic features.
3. **Model Prediction**: Uses a trained machine learning model to predict the language.

---

## Data

The dataset for training the model is sourced from publicly available multilingual datasets. It includes text samples from a variety of languages to ensure robust and accurate detection.
